<div style="text-align:center;font-size:14pt;padding-top:0px;color:black"><b>Deep Prototypes as JavaScript Components</b></div>
<!-- <div style="text-align:center;font-size:10pt;font-family:italic;color:black"><b>for maximizing adaptability</b></div>-->


<p>In normal JavaScript usage, the instantiation of a prototype 
(creation of a new object which inherits from the prototype) is a one-level operation, implemented by
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a>
or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">new</a>.
However, instantiation can be extended to hierarchical structures,
so that trees of arbitrary depth serve as templates from which instances can be spawned at one blow.
It is adequate that the
structures in question be heirarchical (tree-like) in their object-own-property aspect;
internal prototype chains in the templates can be propoageted smoothly to instances if a little care is taken.
 Here's an example of such a structure: </p>


<img id="diagram" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforDocs%2FprototypeDiagram1_withText.svg?alt=media"
      style="bborder:thin black solid;cursor:pointer"  width="550" height="250"/>

<p>Such trees will be referred to as "deep prototypes".
Serialization can be implemented by assigning numeric codes to the nodes  of the tree,
and then building a JSON-compatible description of the graph, including prototype chains and functions. </p>
<p>
 Together,
these capabilities  yield  a component system in which applications are built by instantiation and assembly
from stored elements. After instantiation, the components, being prototypes, are still
"<span style="color:red;text-decoration:underline">live</span>" - that is,
any adjustments are inherited by instances. </p>

<p>The assemblies have a uniform structure which mates
well to a user interface in which prototype structure is exposed.
<i>This yields applications of high adjustability</i> (the purpose of the enterprise). </p>

The idea has been worked out in detail for a particular use-case: diagrams.
Here the components are visual elements (arrows, boxes, labels, and the like), and assemblies thereof
(i.e. diagrams and their parts). Deep prototypes fit the application well, due to the repetitive use of
common elements in diagrams, which is captured by repeated instantiation of common prototypes.
After instantiation the prototypes are still �live�?�?that is, any adjustments are inherited by instances?�?
this is the point of prototypes. Furthermore, an unusually close integration of coding and UI work becomes possible:
parts retain their UI-adjustability when assembled by code, and the deep prototype formalism enables
UI-access to the structure of assemblies, whatever their origin. See https://protopedia.org (all of the code involved is freely available under the MIT license).
<p>Here is a diagram illustrating the component structure: </p>

<img id="diagram" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforDocs%2FprototypeDiagram1_withText.svg?alt=media"
      style="bborder:thin black solid;cursor:pointer"  width="550" height="250"/>

<p style="margin-top:-30px">
 The central requirement is that the structure<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> be hierarchic in  its object-property-value aspect
 (the black and green subgraph).
 <!--(<i>hierarchic prototype</i> is a little clearer, but a mouthful)-->
<a href="/doc/tech.html#definition">Here</a> is a precise description</p>

<!--
<p>Complete application objects (eg charts) are themselves prototype trees, and as such have
a uniform structure which mates well with a uniform user interface. An initial stab at such an interface is the UI
seen in  the above example.-->
<!--However, the prototype-chain aspect is not relevant in every case to end-users.
A minor variant  of the inspector allows hiding of this aspect when irrelevant, or providing explanatory text
when it is. Click here to see the variant.--></p>
