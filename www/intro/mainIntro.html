  <p> In the simple diagram appearing in the workspace to the right, the circles derive from a common prototype, as do the arrows. </p>
  
 <p>The meaning and utility of the concept of a prototype  is general and fairly simple. Click <a style="cursor:pointer"
 onClick="document.getElementById('explain').style.display = 'block';">here</a> for an explanation.</p>
<div id="explain" style="display:none">
 
<p style="padding-left:20px"><span style="margin:3px;border:solid thin black;background-color:red"
onClick="document.getElementById('explain').style.display = 'none';">X</span> When we say that B is a prototype for A (or A is an instance of B), </p>
  <img width="370" style="padding-left:-20px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/JHtAs2VsGjYCqJmOo39SexGq2Fx1%2FforMainPage%2Fprototype.svg?alt=media"/>
<p style="padding-left:20px">we mean that whenever
B has a property, such as a color, A will "inherit" that same color, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
So in describing A, we don't have to repeat all the information about A that it inherits from B. Think of the effort we save in
describing a scarab if we first let on that it is a kind of beetle. 
</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px" >A might inherit from B and B in turn from C.  This is what is called a "prototype chain".
</p>
</div>
  
  <p>In the repository, the diagram is encoded by
  a prototype tree, with a node for each instance and prototype, and it has this structure:</p>
   
  
  <img width="370" style="padding-left:-20px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/JHtAs2VsGjYCqJmOo39SexGq2Fx1%2FforMainPage%2FintroTree2.svg?alt=media"/>
  <p>Note that the visible circles are derived in two steps from the generic description of the circle in the repository. The middle man in this
  derivation is the "Local, Editable Circle Prototype", which gives control collectively over the circles in this diagram (of course, all
  of this goes for the arrows too). This style of derivation can capture the underlying structure of many sorts of software objects.
  (All JavaScript objects contain such derivations - prototype chains - internally, but once stored externally,
  prototype structure is gone - for example JSON discards it). The role of the prototype tree is to provide a uniform and
  storable encoding for the derivations, upon which repositories and  applications, such as ProtoPedia, can be built.</p>
  <p>The user interface gives access to both instances and prototypes. When you select (click on) a circle, the right
  hand panel shows two sets of properties, the properties of the instance, and the properties of its prototype (try it).
  Both are editable. Note that if you edit the "fill" of the prototype, all circles change color, but if you edit the  "fill" of the instance
  only that circle changes color.
