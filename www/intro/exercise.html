<p><b>Mastering prototypes: an exercise</b></p><p>

<p>  The techniques involved in maniuplating diagrams via their prototype structure, being unfamiliar, may
require a bit of practice.  So, we provide an example/exercise which illustrates these techniques.
<!--Once you have completed this
exercise, you will be a master of the prototype realm.--> </p>
<p>

The starting point is:</p>

<img width="250" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/JHtAs2VsGjYCqJmOo39SexGq2Fx1%2Fintro%2Fexercise0.svg?alt=media"/></p>

<p> which also appears in the graphics panel. And here is the end point:</p>

<p>The steps by which the former
can be  transformed into the latter are detailed in what follows. Please follow along, applying the operation associated
with each step to the current item. If anything goes wrong, refresh the page, and start over (undo is coming soon,
but is missing in this early release).
</p>
<p> Step 1 (replacing prototypes): click "Swap Prototype" in the top bar. In the catalog that appears in the right-hand panel, select

<i>connector</i> tab. Click and drag the arc arrow <img width="50" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/JHtAs2VsGjYCqJmOo39SexGq2Fx1%2FforCatalog%2FarcArrow.svg?alt=media"/> over any one of the
existing arrows,  until the existing arrow is highlighted. At that point do the drop (by releasing the mouse key).
The result:</p>

<p>Step 2 (separation): Select the circle labeled "A". First verify that all the circles share the same protototype by clicking
"Show Cohort" on the menu in the left panel. Then click "separate".  This causes circle A to exit its cohort. It has
its own prototype now - this can be verified by clicks on "Show Cohort" with circle A selected, or with any other
circle selected. Next, color the prototype of A blue. For this purpose, select
circle A and 
employ in the property editor in the right hand panel (adjust
the bottom "Prototype" box, not the "Selected Item" box, of course). The result: </p>

<p>Step 3 (Local Swap): Yet again select the circle labeled "A", if it is not selected already. Click "Local Swap"
the menu in the left-hand panel.
This enters a mode in which each click on a compatible item
moves that item into circle A's cohort, where it inherits from circle A's
prototype (in this case, the visible sign is that the item turns blue)
Click each of the other three inner circles.  Finally, exit local swap mode. The result:</p>

<p>Step 4 (editing a property of a prototype).
Now select any one of the outer circles. Set the fill of their prototype to red, using
the same  technique as was used when 
you painted the prototype of circle A blue.  You're done! The result is the goal, once again:</p>
