<div><b>Connections </b></div>

<p>ProtoPedia has support for connecting shapes such
as circles and squares with arrows or lines. When an end of an arrow or line is connected to a shape, it automatically
follows the shape when the shape  is dragged around.</p>
<p>The squares are already connected by the black arrow. Try dragging the squares, and watch the arrow follow.
</p>
<p> The circles are not yet connected. First select the red arrow. Little yellow control boxes will show up.
To connect the head of the arrow to the right-hand circle, drag the head of the arrow by its yellow box  over
the circle (the circle will light up), then drop.  Now the connection  has been made. Try dragging the right hand circle around.
The procedure for connecting the tail is identical. </p>

<p>Once connected you can change the connection point by reselecing the arrow, and then dragging the head or tail of the connected arrow.  
The connection point will follow the
connected
circle or square.  Try it. </p>
