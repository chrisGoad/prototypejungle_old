ProtoPedia supports a conventional sort of file system in which diagrams can be stored.
It is accessible from the file pull-down on the top-bar. The files are held in cloud storage at
Google. You need to be signed in to save files (but everything except this is available without signing in).
Diagrams are saved as items which retain their prototype structure when re-opened. Diagrams can also be
converted to and saved as images via "as SVG" or "as JPEG" in the file menu. If you choose one of these
options, links to the images, and HTML for embeding the images into  web pages are made available.
