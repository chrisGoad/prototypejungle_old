<div class="pageTitle">Sharing Your Work</div>
 
<p>To share your work, create a catalog at top level called "public.catalog" or "stablePublic.catalog".
If you use the latter name, you are indicating that you believe the catalog contents are suitable for long-term use by
others in the PrototypeJungle community. In this case, we will review  the catalog and the code on which it depends, and copy suitable parts into our own stable repository.</p>
<p>
All such contributions (for which much gratitude will be due) will be credited using the name and profile link that you have entered on your
account page. Please consider including an email address on your account page, so that we can communicate with you about your contributions - for example
subsequent upgrades that you might implement to your catalog.</p>

<p>Catalogs named public.catalog will also be credited, and will appear on the catalogs page with a warning as to potential instability.</p>
